# How to play?
1. Move the catcher along the bottom of the screen to catch each egg before it touches the ground.
2.  When you scoop up an egg you score points, but if you drop an egg you lose a life.
3.   Beware: the more eggs you catch, the more frequently new eggs appear at the top of the screen and the faster they fall. 
4.   Lose all three lives and the game ends. 

## Starting the game with Score = 0 and Lives = 3
